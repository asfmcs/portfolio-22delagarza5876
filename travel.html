        <p>This place is located in the center of Mexico, going down to the south. Mexico City is full of colors, nice people, culture and more.

There are such delicious foods like tacos, tamales, enchiladas, chilaquiles and many more that everyone will like. There are also many stores, museums and places for tourists that are so beautiful and entertaining. And that is not it, <strong>Mexico City is also the life of the party</strong>, so at night someone might want to go to the club. It is a great place for everyone, kids, adults and more. </p>

        <h2 style="color:Tomato;">New York, United States </h2>
        <h5 style="color:Tomato;"> "The city that never sleeps"</h5>

        <img src='https://dutchreview.com/wp-content/uploads/Moving-to-the-Netherlands-Amsterdam-1.jpg' width=450>
        <p>Amsterdam is a place very different from the ones above (Mexico City and New York.) This place is is now in Europe and not in North America, making it a little more far than the other places said. But its fine, because Amsterdam is one of a kind. There is not a place like this one. So many things can be done, for example visit the Anne Frank Museum, go through the canals in the city, walk down the streets, go to many restaurants (a lot of different restaurants, like Mexican, Chinese and even from Argentina) visit stores, ride bycicles and much more. This place is also one of those that never runs out of things to do while visiting their city, so it is a place that will never bore its tourits. <strong>The beautiful blooming flowers by the beggining of Spring will want to make you want to buy all of the flowers there are.</strong> This place is one of a kind.

          <p>Madrid is very different from Amsterdam, and is very a like to New York (not personality wise), and looks a little like Paris. This is a Spanish-talking country, making it very unique from the other countries in Europe because it is the only place that talks in Spanish in that continent. There are also so many things to do, for example vivist the museums, go to stores, the mall, walk down the city, meet new places. This place is also very unique because it has very delicious and extravagant food that no other country has. But, don't forget about the night life! Madrid is all about the night, by having a lot of places to party. They have night clubs and more to entertain their people and many others. <strong>This place is magnificent.</strong>

          <p>People say that this is the city of love, but in fact, the people in Paris are very independent and strong.
