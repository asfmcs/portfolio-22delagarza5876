<p>
  My learning of HTML and CSS so far has been pretty good. Before I was able to learn about this topics in class, I didn't even know what HTML/CSS was. Now, I use them for this class and for my learning which have made a lot of positive and better impacts on my daily life. Those are things that I didn't noticed that I needed until today, making them really important to me. Otherwise, things wouldn't be the same when I use the computer because now I know how I can personalize things when there is a problem in a website and how to fix it. Or not in a website, in any place basically that uses HTML/CSS. It is something that is really helpful and also something that everyone should learn to do because it is also really cool and fun.

    Now that I have been learning about HTML/CSS, I know how to make websites with cool fonts, alignments, color, pictures and much more from scratch instead of needing to have the whole template like those that the internet can give you. This is really cool because now I can do the website my way instead of how the template from the interent are. This makes my imagination and creativity open up and make me be more open minded than before because I am using the information I learned in this class, using that to create websites and have a lot more creativity than before. Besides making me have a more open mind and more creatvity, HTML/CSS has been way better because it also helped me learn more behind the scence of a really big interest of mine (the computer.) Now I know more about the things that I like, so it will help me more in the future.
